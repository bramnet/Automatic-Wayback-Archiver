# Automatic-Wayback-Archiver
This is a chrome extension I wrote myself that will automatically archive any web pages you visit while the extension is installed. It's not on the webstore as of now, I'll look into how to do that later.

# Installing
To install, download the repository and go to chrome://extensions in your web browser. Turn on Developer Mode in the top right and click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder that you stored the repo in.
If you downloaded as a .zip, please be sure to unzip it first and use the unziped folder.
